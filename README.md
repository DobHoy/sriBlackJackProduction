This is my first submit to the yeildfy blackjack challenge. 


Things to note: 


1)
  I used the yeoman angular generator to build the app. I used the angular playing cards directive by Nathan Craddock. 
  You can find that [here](https://github.com/nkcraddock/angular-playing-cards). 


2) 
  I looked up the rules of Blackjack and tried to implement a very simple version.
  As such, currently the dealer doesn't draw a card if his score is 17 or above. 
  So if the player's score is above 17, below 21 and larger than the dealer's he/she wins automatically


3) 
  Currently there is no betting or pots involved. I will introduce this for future versions


4) 
  There is a bug where the images for face cards don't show when the yeoman app is hosted on gitpages. 
  The images do show on localhost. I imagine this is issue with the grunt build. I will look into it 
  for future versions


Any comments, issues or feedback? Please email me at sri@ldnstartup.co.uk.
